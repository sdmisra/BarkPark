## Context:
[//]: <>

This project was assigned the 5th week of module 3 at Turing, the work was initially scoped for five days but was completed within 48 hours out of neccessity.

## Learning Goals:
[//]: <>
- Create and deploy a short-scoped React project (5 day timeframe!)
- Fully test E2E coverage of application with Router
- Solidify understanding of React fundamentals with hooks, practice functional programming paradigm

## Challenges & Wins:
- Had to restart mid-project, MVP completed in less than 48 hours after reset
- Ran into blockers regarding API access / CORS policy for some endpoints, found workable solutions anyway

## Future Feature Ideas:

## Installation Instructions:
[//]: <>

- Clone down this repo
- Install dependencies by using ‘npm install’ in your terminal within the root directory.
- To host website on your local machine, run ’npm start’ in terminal.
- A window should be opened in your default browser, if not, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your preferred browser to view the hosted application!

## Testing Instructions:
[//]: <>
To run the test suite associated with the classes behind the scenes and how they interact: 
Run 'npm run cypress' from the terminal while within the main directory of the application and select E2E Testing, and your chosen browser in the following window.

The three testing specs are: Dashboard View, Results View, Saved View
